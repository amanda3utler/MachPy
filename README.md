MachPy is a viewing tool for the Mach data of a subset of cosmological simulation Omega500 catalogue halos (http://gcmc.hub.yt/omega500/index.html). The Mach data itself is is generated via a temperature-jump method based in Martin-Alvarez et al. (2017, https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10509-017-3066-3) and refined by members of the Nagai Group at Yale University.
